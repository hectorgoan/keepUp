# Auto updater/upgrader/cleaner for Debian based distros.

## I was tired of writing this commands again & again.

### Note: Update&Clean.desktop must be copied to the desktop (duh). 
### Note 2: It's necessary to edit the desktop shortcut to specify the full path to keepUp.sh and the icon.

### Note 3: Ubuntu Unity tends to rename the Update&Clean.desktop file to whatever he thinks is cool. Need to find a solution.
