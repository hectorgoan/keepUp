# Auto updater/upgrader/cleaner for:
- Debian based linux distros with ohMyZsh installed
- Darwin systems with homebrew and ohMyZsh installed

#### I was tired of writing this commands again & again.

#### Modes

Argument 					| Action
---------					|-------
_none_   					| Will prompt options
$1 - linux				| Linux distros (will ask Y/N)
$1 - mac					| Darwin systems
$1 - linux, $2 - y		| Linux distros (wont ask Y/N)

Note: On linux distros, Update&Clean.desktop must be copied to the desktop (duh). 

Note 2: It's necessary to edit the desktop shortcut to specify the full path to keepUp.sh and the icon.
